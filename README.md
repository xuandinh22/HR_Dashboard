# Tableau Project – HR Dashboard
## Background and Overview
This project is a guided Tableau learning experience where I built a professional HR Dashboard, following a structured workflow similar to real-world projects. The dashboard is designed to provide HR managers with actionable insights into key workforce metrics, such as department size, gender ratio, education level, performance, and salary. Through this project, I practiced data preparation, visual storytelling, and interactive dashboard design to support strategic HR decision-making.

Insights are provided on the following key areas:

• Overview: Employee distribution by department and location

• Demographics: Relationships between gender and education, education and age, and education and performance

• Income Analysis: Salary differences by education and gender; age and salary trends by job title

An Interactive Tableau dashboard can be downloaded <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/xuan.dinh8619/viz/HR_Dashboard_17537483932760/HRSummary">here</a>

Tools Used: Tableau Public (building dashboard),	Draw.io (design mockups)

## Project Goals
•	Build a professional, interactive HR dashboard from scratch.

•	Learn how to approach a Tableau project from requirements gathering to final visualization.

•	Explore HR data to identify trends in hiring, employee demographics, and salary patterns.

## Dashboard Features
•	Overview: Hired vs. terminated employees, employees by department, job title, and location (HQ vs. branches).

•	Demographics: Gender ratio, age distribution, education levels, and correlation between education and performance ratings.

•	Income Analysis: Salary comparison by education and gender, and salary trends by age and role.

## Process & Steps
1.	Building data source: Prepared and structured the HR dataset for Tableau. Connected and organized data tables for visualization.
2.	Visualization & Interactivity: Built charts for demographics, salary analysis, and workforce trends. Added filters, parameters, and actions to make the dashboard interactive.
3.	Mockups & Design dashboard: Planned the dashboard layout and created mockups using draw.io.
4.	Building dashboard: Assembled visualizations into a cohesive, interactive dashboard. Refined layout, color schemes, and tooltips for a professional look.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
The workforce is composed of 54% male and 46% female employees. The Operations department has the largest staff, while HR has the smallest. Salaries vary depending on education level and gender, and performance ratings generally improve with higher education. Most managerial roles are held by employees aged 40 and above. Below is the overview page from the Tableau dashboard.

### Key Insights

•	Gender distribution: Males represent 54% of the workforce, outnumbering females by 8%.

• Department size: The Operations department has the highest employee count, while HR has the smallest.

•	Education level: The majority of employees hold a bachelor’s degree.

•	Salary patterns: Among employees with a high school education, males earn on average $2K more than females, increasing to an $8K gap at the bachelor’s level. Conversely, females with Master’s degrees earn $6K more than males, and this gap widens to $13K for those with PhDs.

•	Manager age: HR Managers tend to be the youngest managers, generally under 35, whereas managers in other departments are typically above 40.

•	Performance by education: Employees with a high school education show lower performance ratings, while bachelor’s and master’s degree holders perform consistently well, and PhD holders demonstrate the highest performance levels.

## What I Learned

•	Advanced Tableau Functions: Learned how to use window functions like WINDOW_MIN, WINDOW_MAX, and WINDOW_SUM to enhance data analysis.

•	Effective Tooltips: Improved my ability to design informative and interactive tooltips for better user experience.

•	Dashboard Planning: Gained experience in planning dashboard structure, including designing layouts, sections, and interactive elements before building in Tableau.

•	Practical Tableau Skills: Strengthened knowledge of calculated fields, parameters, and interactivity to create a professional, polished dashboard.

•	Dashboard Design Principles: Focused on visual hierarchy, consistent color schemes, and storytelling techniques to highlight insights effectively.

## Conclusion

This HR Dashboard project has strengthened my practical skills in Tableau, from data preparation to creating interactive and insightful visualizations. It has deepened my understanding of HR metrics and how to communicate complex data clearly through effective dashboard design.
